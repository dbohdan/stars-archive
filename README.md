# GitHub stars archive

This is an archive of [my GitHub stars](https://github.com/dbohdan?tab=stars).
Why archive them?
Stars have similar value to browser bookmarks.
If you care enough to bookmark something, you probably want that bookmark backed up.
An export of stars also enables you to perform your own search on them.

Another reason is how GitHub works.
GitHub (intermittently?) disables searching the stars of users who have too many.
At the same time, your results when searching your own stars get more cluttered as their number grows.
This is why you may want to unstar repositories that are no longer relevant.
Since I have reached 2.5k stars, and I have seen search disabled at as many as 3k, cleanup seems due.

It could be interesting to know _when_ I starred a particular repository, but as far as I can tell, this information isn't available through the REST API.
It can only be inferred indirectly through the repository creation date and the order of the stars.
